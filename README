This is now the new official location for the Weblets project formerly hosted on java.net.
Unfortunately the old tags could not be carried over, if you need an old version you still can find
it on the maven central repository (including the sourcecode)


Master currently is the development branch for Weblets 1.3

The current stable version is Weblets  1.2

Weblets comes with extensive documentation follow this link http://werpu.github.com/weblets/www/doc_12/longdoc/index.html
