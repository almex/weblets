      <div class="section"><h2>Introduction into the weblets API</h2>
<p>As of version 1.1 a programming API is exposed to program your own Weblets. Weblets uses a servlet like internal API to handle the resource loading. The Resource Loading is a multi step process covered by this API. As of 1.1 only following Weblets are predefined: A package weblet which allows the resource serving from resources located in the classpath! A sourcecode Weblet in the demo application which serves the JSP pages as source listings into the webapp and a proxying Weblet which allows proxying of resources hosted at another location like a resource server to be served transparently.</p>
<div class="section"><h3>Programming Weblets a step by step introduction ** Why Your Own Weblets?</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is desirable to build your own weblet containers, which serve special needs. For instance, a custom container could serve resources the webapp way, with resources located directly in the web application file structure. Another one could stream resources from data sources like blobs in a database. Another one could redirect to a dedicated clustered resource server to handle high volume loads. The possibilities are endless. But before reaching the goal some effort has to be put into it.</p>
<div class="section"><h4>Basic Structures of a Weblet</h4>
<p>Weblets follows an api which is very similar to the servlet API. A basic hello world weblet would look like this:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>public class SourcecodeWeblet extends Weblet {

            public void service(
                    WebletRequest request,
                    WebletResponse response) throws IOException {

                //hello world, we have to do something in here
            }
        
            public InputStream serviceStream(String pathInfo, String mimetype) throws IOException, WebletException {
                                return null; 
                }
                
        
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The central callback point is the method service, with a request and response object very similar to the servlet request and response objects. (In fact in most containers they just build a facade over exactly those two objects adding certain behavioral methods to the request response Objects of the underlying servlet container.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>    public void service WebletRequest request, WebletResponse response) throws IOException;</pre>
</div>
<p>The second callback point is the serviceStream methiod, this one has been added in Weblets 1.1 to allow the streaming of resources into reporting systems or other batch like systems which can live inside the server but do not necessarily have a request scope at the time of calling. But later to that. Under normal circumstances you can keep this method empty unless you need your resources in such a system.</p>
<p>However if you work with weblets it is recommended to use exactly those two objects access the needed request and response data!</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4>Servicing a Weblet</h4>
<p>We have the request and response objects but we do not know how to handle the resources. Theoretically we now could do it manually by just streaming resources like we would do it in a servlet. Yes this would work, but we would lose things like browser cache control, versioning etc...</p>
<p>There is a better way. Weblets provides its own API for streaming resources.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>
        public class SourcecodeWeblet extends Weblet {

                    public void service(WebletRequest request, WebletResponse response) throws IOException {
                    String resourcePath = _resourceRoot + request.getPathInfo();
                    CopyStrategy CopyStrategy = new CopyStrategyImpl();
                    URL url = WebletResourceloadingUtils.getInstance().getResourceUrl(request, resourcePath);
                    WebletResourceloadingUtils.getInstance().loadFromUrl(getWebletConfig(),
                            request, response, url, CopyStrategy);
                }
        }</pre>
</div>
<p>This is the simplest case of a packaged weblet. What happens here, is that we basically generate our path from the path info part of our weblet request (the weblet name itself already is covered by the weblet name part and calls our weblet itself) and then we use the default copy strategy, which is a simple file copy on binary files and weblets notation parsing and replacing on text files to copy the files. The browser cache control part and mime type handling part, is handled before the copying in the WebletResourceloadingUtils class.</p>
<p>The Versioning notation etc... all comes from request.getPathInfo();</p>
<p>Now we can see there are two several points for interference, the service part as central resource loading part the input url or input stream as central root of your resource which can be any location, and the CopyStrategy implementation which does the central copying from an input source to an output source.</p>
<p>Most of the times you just have to tinker with the input sources to reach a certain result, for instance a weblet which serves resources directly from a webapp has to use a different mechanism to define the root of the resource</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        URL url = httpRequest.getSession().getServletContext().getResource(&quot;/&quot;+resourcePath);
        WebletResourceloadingUtils.getInstance().loadFromUrl(getWebletConfig(), request, response, url, copyStrategy);</pre>
</div>
<p>Other input source types would be feasible for instance a proxying of servers would be possible the following way:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        URL url = new URL(&quot;http://www.john-doe.com/&quot;+resourcePath);
        WebletResourceloadingUtils.getInstance().loadFromUrl(getWebletConfig(), request, response, url, copyStrategy);</pre>
</div>
<p>This would stream in resources from a remote server by using the facilities the url class provides.</p>
<p>Now what happens if we have a data source which is not url-able. There would be several ways, the apache <tt>commons-vfs</tt>
 provides a way to <tt>url</tt>
ify every resource there is via a vfs like system. The other way would be to use the internal apis for streaming from input streams from the WebletResourceLoadingUtils class.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        loadResourceFromStream(WebletConfig config, WebletRequest request, WebletResponse response, CopyStrategy copyStrategy, InputStream in,
                                long resourceLastmodified) throws IOException;</pre>
</div>
<p>This method allows the same as with our URLs as inputs, but replaces the URL with an input stream and a resourceLastModified parameter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4>The Copy Strategy</h4>
<p>To enable various methods of pre and post processing, a strategy pattern has been applied to Weblets to allow input and output stream processing. The central point for the Weblets processing engine is the copy strategy interface. A copy strategy is an implemented strategy pattern for in copy processing. In its default implementation it allows the stream copying of binary files and parses text files for our weblets:url and weblets:resource patterns and replaces them with the correct urls for calling our resources. Under normal circumstances nothing else has to be done in this regard. Normally if you program a weblet using the CopyStrategyImpl class should be enough to enable all your processing needs for resources.</p>
<p>However, there are cases where you need to write your own copy strategy, for instance </p>
<ol type="1"><li>if you need javascript on the fly compression or </li>
<li>if you want to add advanced caching mechanisms to the already existing browser cache control and stream buffering. </li>
<li>Watermarking with on the fly image watermarks also would be a feasible option to be done by the Copy Strategy implementing class.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets dissect the parts of an implemented copy strategy class for easier understanding:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>
        public class SourcecodeCopyStrategy extends CopyStrategyImpl implements CopyStrategy {

            public void copy(String webletName, String mimeType, InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
                copyText(webletName, new InputStreamReader(in), new OutputStreamWriter(out));
            }

            protected void copyText(String webletName, Reader in, Writer out) throws IOException {
                byte[] buffer = new byte[2048];
                int len = 0;
                int total = 0;
                BufferedReader bufIn = new BufferedReader(mapResponseReader(webletName, in));
                PrintWriter bufOut = new PrintWriter(mapResponseWriter(out));
                try {
                    writehttphead(bufOut);
                    writeResource(bufIn, bufOut);
                    writehttpbottom(bufOut);
                } finally {
                    bufIn.close();
                    bufOut.close();
                }
            }

            private void writehttpbottom(PrintWriter writer) {
                writer.write(&quot;\n&quot;);
                writer.write(&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;);
            }

            private void writeResource(BufferedReader reader, PrintWriter writer) throws IOException {
                while (reader.ready()) {
                    String line = reader.readLine();
                    line = line.replaceAll(&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;).replaceAll(&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;);
                    writer.write(line);
                    writer.println();
                }
            }

            private void writehttphead(PrintWriter writer) {
                writer.write(&quot;&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \&quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\&quot;&gt;&quot;);
                writer.write(&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&quot;);
                writer.write(&quot;&lt;link rel=\&quot;stylesheet\&quot; href=\&quot;&quot;);
                writer.write(WebletUtils.getURL(&quot;weblets.demo&quot;, &quot;/styles/weblets.css&quot;));
                writer.write(&quot;\&quot; &gt;&lt;/link&gt;&quot;);
                writer.write(&quot;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=\&quot;header_bg\&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=\&quot;content\&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&quot;);
                writer.write(&quot;\n&quot;);
            }
        }
</pre>
</div>
<p>This is a simple copy strategy which does some post processing on sourcecode to beautify it with a little bit of decoration.</p>
<p>The main entry points are defined by the CopyStrategy interface</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        /**
         * Central contractual interface for our copy strategy control usually a copy provider chains some input output streams together to get a certain behavior
         */
        public interface CopyStrategy {
            /**
             * central copy method
             *
             * @param the weblet name the weblet name
             * @param mimetype the response mimetype
             * @param in the incoming data input stream
             * @param out the receiving steam
             * @throws java.io.IOException in case of an error
             */
            void copy(String webletName, String mimetype, InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException;

            /**
             * wraps the incoming input stream with out post processing filters
             * @param the weblet name
             * @param in the incoming stream
             *
             * @return an inputstream with the resource or null if none is found
             * @throws IOException  in case of a severe error
             */
            public InputStream wrapInputStream(String webletName, String mimetype, InputStream in) throws IOException;

        }</pre>
</div>
<p>Two central points define every copy strategy, the copy operation itself and the filter chain doing the stream processing. Most of the times you probably only have to implement one, either the <tt>wrapInputStream</tt>
 class adding to your chain or your own copy operation additionally to the default copy behavior by exposing the <tt>copy</tt>
 operation. This operation is only called so far by the <tt>serviceStream</tt>
 most of the times you can use it from your copy operation or omit it by simply delivering the input stream as return value</p>
<p>The central operation itself is the copy operation</p>
<p>In our example we have overriden the copy operation by decorating the incoming text with our own html code to beautify it a little bit.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>

        public class SourcecodeCopyStrategy extends CopyStrategyImpl implements CopyStrategy {

            public void copy(String webletName, String mimeType, InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
                copyText(webletName, new InputStreamReader(in), new OutputStreamWriter(out));
            }

                 protected void copyText(String webletName, Reader in, Writer out) throws IOException {
                        byte[] buffer = new byte[2048];
                        int len = 0;
                        int total = 0;
                        BufferedReader bufIn = new BufferedReader(mapResponseReader(webletName, in));
                        PrintWriter bufOut = new PrintWriter(mapResponseWriter(out));
                        try {
                            writehttphead(bufOut);
                            writeResource(bufIn, bufOut);
                            writehttpbottom(bufOut);
                        } finally {
                            bufIn.close();
                            bufOut.close();
                        }
                  }
                ...     </pre>
</div>
<p>Another example would be our packaged weblet with the default CopyProviderImpl. The main issue with this class was that text and binary streams had to be processed differently, different chains, different copy behavior depending on the type of file:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>
   public void copy(String webletName, String contentType, InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
                boolean isText = isText(contentType);
                if (isText)
                        copyText(webletName, new InputStreamReader(in), new OutputStreamWriter(out));
                else
                        copyStream(in, out);
        }

        private boolean isText(String contentType) {
                return contentType != null &amp;&amp; (contentType.startsWith(&quot;text/&quot;) || contentType.endsWith(&quot;xml&quot;) || contentType.equals(&quot;application/x-javascript&quot;));
        }
 
        protected void copyText(String webletName, Reader in, Writer out) throws IOException {
                        byte[] buffer = new byte[2048];
                        int len = 0;
                        int total = 0;
                        BufferedReader bufIn = mapResponseReader(webletName, in);
                        BufferedWriter bufOut = mapResponseWriter(out);
                        try {
                                String line = null;
                                while ((line = bufIn.readLine()) != null) {
                                        bufOut.write(line);
                                        bufOut.write(&quot;\n&quot;);
                                }
                        } finally {
                                bufIn.close();
                                bufOut.close();
                        }
        }

        protected void copyStream(InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
                        byte[] buffer = new byte[2048];
                        BufferedInputStream bufIn = mapInputStream(in);
                        BufferedOutputStream bufOut = mapOutputStream(out);
                        int len = 0;
                        int total = 0;
                        try {
                                while ((len = bufIn.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {
                                        bufOut.write(buffer, 0, len);
                                        total += len;
                                }
                        } finally {
                                bufIn.close();
                                bufOut.close();
                        }
        }
        
        protected BufferedReader mapResponseReader(String webletName, Reader in) {
                return new TextProcessingReader(in, webletName);
        }
        </pre>
</div>
<p>Now here we see that from the input stream to the input stream after the processing we use a reader in the chain which does the entire text processing, to map it back into a stream Weblets provides its own Reader -&gt; InputStream mapping class <tt>InputStreamReader</tt>
 (there is a hole in the java api, java does not provide such a backwards class).</p>
<p>What happens is that a filter chain is built on top of the input stream and in the middle of this chain the text is changed on the fly with a parsing class <tt>TextProcessingReader</tt>
 which parses for weblets:url and resource patterns.</p>
<p>For a caller outside nothing has changed everything still is an input stream.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4>Security</h4>
<p>Lets face it, the world is insecure, web applications can insecure and serving resources opens security holes. Following code would serve anything to the world (probably even your grandmother if she would be there).</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        
        fullAddr.append(httpRequest.getSession().getServletContext().getRealPath(request.getPathInfo()));
        String resourcePath = fullAddr.toString();

        CopyStrategy copyProvider = new SourcecodeCopyStrategy();
       
        response.setContentType(&quot;text/html&quot;);
        FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(resourcePath);

        WebletResourceloadingUtils.getInstance().loadResourceFromStream(getWebletConfig(), request, response,  copyProvider, fin);
        </pre>
</div>
<p>This theoretically can serve every resource in your filesystem to the frontend.</p>
<p>Basically what we have to deal with are two security concerns we have to address:</p>
<p>a) Never serve unwanted resources or resources from a directory not really accessible for the enduser b) Never allow that with the tampering of URLs it is possible to break out of a designated sandbox you advice to the resource pack to hold your resources.</p>
<p>For packaged resources a) should not be of importance unless you do not address b. Only resources located in the package under normal circumstances can be affected. However if you serve resources from the local filesystem a) becomes an issue. The problem lies in the servlet API itself. While servlets and their configuration have good shields of not providing resources they should not provide, they do not have those shields at their api level. You can access the path information via the servlet api, but it does not block you from accessing the WEB-INF directories or the context directories, jsp files are not translated into html either, this way.</p>
<p>Always if you program your own weblet and you are in a critical environment have that in mind. Never let the code go lower than your root context, never let the code access your configuration map files which should not be seen or block them entirely, try to block break out the sandbox approaches via url tampering (injecting ..).</p>
<p>Weblets does not leave you alone with those concerns. While the normal sourcecode example does not have any security weblets does. For packaged weblets you have everything in place you do not have to be concerned anymore.</p>
<p>If you roll your own weblet then you have several infrastructural facilities which should ease the burdens which are laid on you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4>Sandboxing your resources</h4>
<p>This basically means your resources are located within a root which only can host resources, nothing else. Weblets adresses jailbreak prevention already on container level (From the Weblet container implementation):</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        public void service(
                WebletRequest request,
                WebletResponse response) throws IOException, WebletException {
            Weblet weblet = getWeblet(request);

            String pathInfo = request.getPathInfo();
            if (response.getDefaultContentType() == null) {


                //enhanced security check
                if (pathInfo != null &amp;&amp; SandboxGuard.isJailBreak(pathInfo)) {
                    throw new WebletException(&quot;Security Exception, the &quot; + pathInfo +
                            &quot; breaks out of the resource jail, no resource is served!&quot;);
                }

                WebletConfig webConfig = weblet.getWebletConfig();
                if (pathInfo != null) {
                    String mimeType = webConfig.getMimeType(pathInfo);
                    response.setDefaultContentType(mimeType);
                }
            }


            WebletConfig webConfig = weblet.getWebletConfig();
            Set allowedResources = webConfig.getAllowedResources();

            if (allowedResources != null) {
                 String filetype = StringUtils.getExtension(pathInfo);
                 if (!allowedResources.contains(filetype.toLowerCase())) {
                     throw new WebletException(&quot;Security Exception, the &quot; + pathInfo +
                             &quot;  resource cannot be served!&quot;);
                    /* not allowed no content delivered */
                 }
             }

            weblet.service(request, response);</pre>

<p>This means, every Weblet already has sidestepping and downstepping prevention and every weblet root is seen as a jail which is not allowed to be broken out! Unless you want to open new security holes (like we did in our example above) we do not need to take care of anything in this regard anymore, the class <tt>SandboxGuard</tt>
 takes care of those issues.</p>
<p>The second part is the mime type handling, this is an opt in option. Since 1.1 we have a better mime type handling every Weblet now also allows the setting of a list of allowedResources in its config:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>                &lt;init-param&gt;
              &lt;param-name&gt;allowedResources&lt;/param-name&gt;
              &lt;param-value&gt; jpg, png &lt;/param-value&gt;
            &lt;/init-param&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>If this parameter is set then the file extension protection is on in &quot;full force&quot;. Only jpg and png extensions are allowed in this case no other file can be served from the filesystem. For the programmer this comes free, you do not have to take care of it, all you have to do is to make sure this option is enabled by default!</p>
<p><tt>Now what about directory exclusion</tt>
 For now Weblets has no dedicated mechanism for doing that, if you want to do that you can do it within your service method of your Weblet.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        public void service(WebletRequest request, WebletResponse response) throws IOException {
                String resourcePath = _resourceRoot + request.getPathInfo();
                // this might fail on some containers overriding the HttpServlet
                // but for demo purposes this is ok
                HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request.getExternalRequest();
        
                /*we now have the resource handling decoupled from the mimetypes*/
        
                CopyStrategy copyProvider = new CopyStrategyImpl();
                if (resourcePath.indexOf(&quot;WEB-INF/&quot;) != -1 || resourcePath.indexOf(&quot;WEB-INF\\&quot;) != -1) {
                        // security breach nothing in WEB-INF is allowed to be accessed
                        return;
                }
            if (resourcePath.indexOf(&quot;META-INF/&quot;) != -1 || resourcePath.indexOf(&quot;META-INF\\&quot;) != -1) {
                // security breach nothing in WEB-INF is allowed to be accessed
                return;
            }

        URL url = httpRequest.getSession().getServletContext().getResource(&quot;/&quot;+resourcePath);
        WebletResourceloadingUtils.getInstance().loadFromUrl(getWebletConfig(), request, response, url, copyProvider);
        }</pre>
</div>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>You get a lot of security out of the box, if we revisit our anti example in the beginning:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        
        fullAddr.append(httpRequest.getSession().getServletContext().getRealPath(request.getPathInfo()));
        String resourcePath = fullAddr.toString();

        CopyStrategy copyProvider = new SourcecodeCopyStrategy();
       
        response.setContentType(&quot;text/html&quot;);
        FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(resourcePath);

        WebletResourceloadingUtils.getInstance().loadResourceFromStream(getWebletConfig(), request, response,  copyProvider, fin);
        </pre>
</div>
<p>Is basically bad, but weblets per default at least takes care of sidestepping and trying to break out of the resource root (in this case probably the webapp itself and its root context)</p>
<p>Adding following lines to the weblets-config.xml would add additional filetype security:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>        &lt;init-param&gt;
            &lt;param-name&gt;allowedResources&lt;/param-name&gt;
            &lt;param-value&gt; jsp, jspx, html &lt;/param-value&gt;
        &lt;/init-param&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>So only jsp, jspx and html files can be served, an attempt to serve anything else would result in a security exception!</p>
<p>All of this comes out of the box if you program your own Weblet, if you need additional security (locking of certain directories etc...) you have to program it on your own in your service and serviceStream methods!</p>
