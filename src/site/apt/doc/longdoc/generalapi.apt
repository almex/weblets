Introduction to the API Patterns

    <<<Weblets>>> contain two parts in their execution pipeline, a frontend <<<API>>>, which enables a
    neutral notation for application developers to isolate the resource call from the actual calling protocol and position.
     a url resolution stage, which intercepts the actual resource call and serves the
    resource from a given datasource.

* General Functions 

    The application of those principles is very easy, all the application programmer has to use,
    is the frontend specific <<<API>>>.

    <<<Weblets>>> tries to stay the same as much as possible in its <<<APIs>>> and their results over all frameworks, so that
    the application programmer can be sure that the final result stays the same, not depending
    on the underlying framework being used.

    The basic idea of the Weblet fronted API, are two contractual functions/methods.

  <Code 1: Contract Functions/Methods>

+--------------------------------------------------

    url(<webletname>,<path to resource>)
    resource(<webletname>,<path to resource>)

+--------------------------------------------------

    In every framework supported, you always will find them  one way or the other.

    The main difference between those two contractual methods is, that <<<url>>> serves up
    a full url including the current web application context, while <<<resource>>>
    only serves up the relative path to the resource.

    The following code example shows the differences between the two functions.

    <Code 2: Difference between url and resource in a pseudo  API>

+----------------------------------------------------------------------

        url ("org.myapp.html","/myresource.js")
        resolves to /my-webapp/faces/weblets/myapp/myresource.js

        resource( "org.myapp.html","/myresource.js")
        resolves to /faces/weblets/myapp/myresource.js
